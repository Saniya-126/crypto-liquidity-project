## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are known for high volatility. One key factor influencing price stability is **liquidity** â€” the ease with which assets can be bought or sold. Low liquidity can lead to large price swings and instability. 

This project uses historical crypto data to build a machine learning model that predicts liquidity trends and helps anticipate crises in the market.
